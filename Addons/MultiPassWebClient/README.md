Sometimes you want to maintain multiple passwords at once, for multiple runtime environments.

Consider the following case: A simple Web/DB application, in production, test and development machines.
The following credentials are involved:
- Server Login (root, john_doe)        => two credentials
- MySql Login (root, phpuser, john_doe)  => another three

Five credentials to maintain among three set of servers, you might want to consolidate PWIDs.
